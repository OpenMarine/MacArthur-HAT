# MacArthur-HAT

![MacArthur-HAT](images/macarthur-render.jpg)

After a few years of developing software for **OpenPlotter**, we have identified exactly what we need in terms of hardware to achieve our goals and the result is the **MacArthur HAT** (Hardware Attached on Top), an add-on board for **Raspberry Pi** running OpenPlotter. With this HAT we want to get the fully open-source boat to free ourselves from dependence on big companies and make our boats more respectful with the environment.

> KiCad files will be released when the board is in production.
